_JavaScript Challenges_

## Starting ðŸš€

_Little JavaScript exercises made by Enzo Cremella._

### Previous requirements ðŸ“‹

_What do I need to run those exercises?_

_You have to download the next tools:_
_-Code editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code and Atom)_
_-GitBash (Optional: If you want to upload it into GitHub, it is the best tool to do it)_
_-Browser (I recommend Google Chrome. Mozilla is not my favourite browser, but it is faster than Chrome)_
