# Project Title

_JavaScript Challenges_

## Starting 🚀

_Little JavaScript exercises made by Enzo Cremella._

### Previous requirements 📋

_What do I need to run those exercises?_

_You have to download the next tools:_

*  Code editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code and Atom).

*  GitBash (Optional: If you want to upload it into GitHub, it is the best tool to do it).

*  Browser (I recommend Google Chrome. Mozilla is not my favourite browser, but it is faster than Chrome).
